A further rework of [my previous ESP32 conversion of GreatScott's Nixie Clock](https://github.com/JebKerman91/Nixie-ESP32).

Both the Arduino sketches (for testing and for normal use) as well as the PCB gerber file are included.

The basic functioning is unchanged, but the PCB was redesigned from scratch in order to better integrate the Arduino Nano ESP32 board and to adopt IN-12 tubes, which seem to be more robust and are much easier to socket compared to the previously-used IN-14 tubes, which were soldered - the goal was to make it easier to replace in case of fault or damage.

Othere required materials are described [here on Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/1280386-arduino-nano-esp32-based-nixie-clock-with-in-12-tu), where also the 3D-printable enclosure files are made available.
